# Drum-Kit

This is Drum Kit which simulates different notes of a Drummer. This project was made using JavaScript as main Language along with HTML and CSS for Styling

Interestingly each Note is assigned with a alphabet. So even if we click that same letters on keyboard it can still take input and it can play the sound assigned to it.

This Project is hosted on https://utkarsh552.github.io/Drum-Kit/
